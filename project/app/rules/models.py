    A ``deterministic`` rule is its ``conditions``: a structured, versioned

    declares and the figures derived from them, evaluated in-process. An
    ``inference`` rule adds ``inference_prompt``, a natural-language predicate
    the LLM seam evaluates against the lead's sanitized, fenced data, and may
    stand on that predicate alone. Conditions on an inference rule are
    optional and act as a gate: the model is asked only once they hold, so a
    lead the structured part already ruled out costs no provider call.

    Rules are not first-match: every one is evaluated, each rule that fires
    adds its ``weight`` to its action's tally, and the heaviest tally is the
    action proposed (``services.select_action``). Several rules may select the
    same action, so a strong signal and a weak one can agree and outweigh a
    lone rival. A tally of 1 — one weight-1 rule alone — proposes nothing, as
    does no rule firing at all: both route the lead to a human.
