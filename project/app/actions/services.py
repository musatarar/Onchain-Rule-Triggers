"""The actions engine: enqueue a lead, claim its job, run it to a decision.

One job runs as four steps -- read the lead and the events it was queued for,
the deterministic pass (pure Python, no tokens), the inference pass for what is
left (:mod:`project.app.rules.inference`, one provider call unless the run is
dry), then the weight tally the rules entity already owns
(``rules.services.select_action``). The chosen
action and the tally's workings land on the job; the copy for one is drafted
later, on demand (:func:`compose`), through the planner's own machinery.

Every status write is a conditional UPDATE from the status it expects, so two
crons running the same batch cannot both process a job.
