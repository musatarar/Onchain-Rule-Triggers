"""On-chain rules against one stored block: which of its rows satisfy a rule.

A rule's tree is walked as stored (``AND`` is all of its children, ``OR`` any
of them), not through the v1 payload. One evaluation binds at most one row per
source, so every comparison in it reads the same block, the same transaction
and the same token transfer:

- a tree reading ``transaction`` or ``token_transfer`` is tried against each
  transaction in the block, bound with each of its token transfers in turn,
  or with none when it has none. The transaction matches when one of those
  bindings satisfies the tree, so two ``token_transfer`` comparisons have to
  hold of one transfer, and ``absent`` on a transfer field means no transfer
  was decoded for the transaction;
- a tree reading ``withdrawal`` is tried against each withdrawal in the block;
- a tree reading only ``block`` is tried against the block.

A transaction's token transfers are the ones decoding stored for it
(:mod:`project.app.evm.decoding`): the ``transfer`` or ``transferFrom`` its
calldata makes, unchecked against its receipt. A token moved by a contract the
transaction calls leaves no transfer, so ``absent`` holds of that transaction
too. Before decoding has finished with every transaction in the block, their
transfers are not all stored, so a tree reading ``token_transfer`` is refused
with :class:`NotDecodedError` rather than judged on the ones that are.

A block's rows are the ones stored with it, named by its hash, since a reorg
can put two blocks at one number. A row stored before block hashes were
recorded names no block, so no block reads it until its block is stored again.

A comparison on a source the binding leaves unbound (a ``token_transfer``
comparison with no transfer bound) reads no value: ``absent`` holds of it,
``exists`` and every other operator do not. Quantities are compared exactly,
as ``Decimal``: a uint256 is past what a float holds. A block's ``timestamp``
is compared by its UTC date, since a date threshold names a day.

The block's rows are read once, whatever the number of transactions:
:func:`matches_in_block` runs one query for the transactions (or withdrawals),
one for their token transfers when the tree reads them, and none for a tree
that came prefetched. Evaluating many rules against one block, pass them one
:class:`BlockRows`: each kind of row is read the first time a rule needs it
and shared by every rule after, so the queries a block costs do not grow with
the number of rules.
