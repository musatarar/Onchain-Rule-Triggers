# CLAUDE.md

Agentic outreach planner. Django 4.2 + DRF backend; React 18/TS frontend built by Vite into
a bundle committed at project/app/static/frontend/ and served by Django (no Node in the
runtime image). A Lead is id + owner + data and an Event is lead + timestamp + data; the
owner's Shape declares each column's name, type and whether the lead authored it, plus the
two roles (contact and agency), and every reader goes through it. Rule functions in
services/outreach.py select leads for outreach; provider calls generate message text only; services/verify.py checks generated copy against stored
lead/event fields and blocks approval when checks fail; a human approval gate guards every
draft, and approved copy leaves via the reviewer's clipboard — the app sends nothing itself.

## Commands

```bash
# setup: venv + `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`, then
python scripts/setup_env.py    # .env with a generated key; never overwrites an existing one
python manage.py migrate && python scripts/populate_demo_data.py && python manage.py runserver
# populate_demo_data seeds leads/events and the demo user's rules catalog; it is
# idempotent. `--reset` empties every table first (users and login tokens too).

# tests — Django's unittest runner. There is NO pytest, no conftest. Modules are
# tests_<subject>.py and test names are behavioral sentences: grep the behavior in English.
python manage.py test project.app                                   # full backend suite
python manage.py test project.app.tests.tests_review.Cls.test_name  # one test
DATABASE_URL=<postgres-url> python manage.py test project.app       # Postgres parity
coverage run manage.py test project.app && coverage report          # floor 90, pyproject

# lint / types / migrations — before any commit; this mirrors CI
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy project/app/services/                          # CI typechecks this path, nothing more
python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run   # must be clean

# actions engine cron: queue the leads with no open job, then run the batch.
# compose runs this on a loop in the `cron` service (docker/cron.sh).
python manage.py run_action_jobs [--limit N] [--no-enqueue]

# frontend — only when frontend/ changed. NEVER hand-edit the built bundle.
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
git diff --exit-code -- project/app/static/frontend/   # CI fails on a stale bundle
```

## Where things are

actions/ is the queue and the cron: one ActionJob per lead, resolved by the deterministic
pass (actions/evaluate.py, the evaluator for the conditions vocabulary rules/utils.py
validates) or the stubbed inference pass, then the rules entity's own weight tally. A job
runs the catalog of lead.owner; an unowned lead has no rules. The vocabulary is read off
the owner's shape, so it can widen past what evaluate.py resolves — an unresolved field is
refused at evaluation and recorded on the job, never fired. Runs are dry by default
(ACTIONS_LLM_DRY_RUN): the inference pass asks nothing and says so on every job it touches,
until an operator sets exactly False. A lead a run decided today with no newer event is not
re-queued, so an unchanged lead is judged once a day, not once a tick.
services/outreach.py is the rules engine and the planner (numbered phases in comments);
services/llm/ is the provider-agnostic layer; services/verify.py is the grounding verifier.
Registries, to find anything: project/app/models/__init__.py, views/__init__.py,
serializers/__init__.py, frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts (every API call, one line each).
Constraint and index names appear verbatim in the model and its migration — grep the name.

## Planning — before building anything new

Any feature, behaviour change, or refactor goes through `.claude/skills/plan-feature` first:
the smallest change that satisfies the ask, every inferred extra listed for a human to accept
or defer, and the confirmed plan filed as a GitHub issue. That includes a prerequisite you
discover mid-task ("first the lead needs an owner"): it is an ask of its own, not part of the
one you are on. This is an MVP; a shared module, a flag, or a follow-up is a decision, not
hygiene.

## Database & migrations — hard rules

- NEVER edit a migration committed on the default branch. Additive follow-ups only.
- DDL that is instant on SQLite can stall Postgres: index adds take a SHARE lock, ALTER
  TABLE constraint adds take ACCESS EXCLUSIVE. Any index or constraint on outreachaction,
  lead or event is a hot-table change — prefer concurrent ops with `atomic = False`, and
  get human review.
- One concern per migration. Schema migrations carry no data operations; seeding lives in
  idempotent management commands (zero RunPython migrations — keep it so).
- New columns: nullable-or-constant-default first, backfill via a management command, then
  constrain. Do not write to the local SQLite file; the test runner makes a throwaway one.

## ORM, transactions, async seam

- No list endpoint serializes an unbounded table: pagination and a throttle scope for every
  new list or expensive endpoint (settings.py REST_FRAMEWORK block).
- Only `.all()` is served from a prefetch cache; a filtered call re-queries. Slice in Python.
- No Django signals; all writes go through explicit service functions.
- Race-sensitive logic gets a database-level guard (partial unique constraint or conditional
  UPDATE), never read-then-check. Copy the single-use login-token redemption or the
  reopen-of-dismiss revoke.
- ATOMIC_REQUESTS is off. Writes that must land together go in one explicit
  `transaction.atomic` block in the service function that owns them; `select_for_update`
  only inside one. Never hold a transaction open across the provider-call phase.
- services/llm/ must not import Django at module level (runtime.py keeps its Django imports
  function-local), so it stays importable unconfigured. If a provider call ever moves back
  onto an event loop, no ORM call may run inside that phase — SynchronousOnlyOperation at
  runtime, and nothing static warns you.

## LLM layer

- Selection is environment-only (services/llm/config.py): LLM_PROVIDER (default groq),
  LLM_MODEL (blank = the adapter's DEFAULT_MODEL), the provider's key variable. Nothing is
  stored in the database or editable through the API.
- Adding a provider means two edits: the client registry (services/llm/__init__.py) and the
  env-var map (services/llm/config.py, also the set of values LLM_PROVIDER accepts).
- Retryability lives on the error class (services/llm/errors.py). Retry policy and timeouts
  are cost multipliers — flag any change as a spend change.
- Never log or persist raw prompts or completions.
- The stub provider is gated by OUTREACH_ALLOW_STUB_LLM=1, for tests only. Never weaken it.

## Security invariants — do not weaken, escalate instead

- Lead-controlled text (CRM notes, event payloads) is untrusted everywhere: sanitize before
  it enters any prompt, in the frontend too.
- `suggested_copy` is immutable once written; a reviewer's edit lands in `edited_copy`, so
  the two can always be diffed.
- The verifier fails closed: a missing or blank verification report blocks approval.
- COPY_VERIFY_LEVEL=off disables grounding checks silently. Never set it in committed
  config; treat any diff containing it as human-review-required.
- Magic-link auth stores only hashed tokens, single-use via conditional UPDATE, with
  timing-equalized failure paths and REMOTE_ADDR-only IP trust. Human-gated.

## Settings & env

- All configuration is environment variables; settings.py owns every default (docker-compose
  passes planner knobs through blank on purpose — do not restate defaults there).
- Use the `_env_int` / `_env_float` / `_env_number` / `_env_list` helpers for new variables:
  blank means unset, bad values raise ImproperlyConfigured naming the variable.
- Closed matrix: every variable the app reads has a `.env.example` entry and a
  docker-compose passthrough, and nothing is documented that is not read. Exceptions:
  Django's own DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE and the test-only OUTREACH_ALLOW_STUB_LLM gate.
- Minimal holds inside a helper too: a boolean reads `true`/`false` like the existing one,
  not a synonym table. Accept what the ask named and raise on the rest.
- DJANGO_SECRET_KEY is mandatory (boot fails without it). Boot-time checks live in
  project/app/checks.py — add one when a misconfiguration should fail boot, not first use.

## Tests

- setUpTestData and factory helpers; pin dates to constants (the suites freeze TODAY) rather
  than reading the clock; patch `django.utils.timezone.now` only where the code under test
  reads it.
- Every LLM interaction is mocked — doubles subclass the real LLMClient so seam changes fail
  loudly. Never let a test reach a real provider.
- Do not edit or delete an existing test to make a change pass; that needs human sign-off
  first, for the test or the code.
- DRF throttle history persists across tests — clear it in setUp/tearDown as tests_auth.py does.

## Comments

- One line, or none. Default to no comment; when the code is not obvious, say why in a single
  line. Never write the second line.
- Alternatives considered, non-goals, and design history do not go in the code. They go in the
  commit message, the PR, or SECURITY.md.
- Module and class docstrings are one line. Tests get none; the test name is the sentence.

## What always needs a human before merge

Migrations; auth/session/throttle code; the approval gate; sanitization and verifier logic;
feature-flag default flips; anything changing provider spend (models, retries, concurrency,
prompt size); any retention or deletion touching LoginToken; any change to .claude/ or CI
workflow configuration.

## Deploy (placeholders — code does not determine these)

- Production server/WSGI setup: <not yet defined — the container runs the dev server>
- Production DATABASE_URL / migration execution window: <define with the deploy story>
