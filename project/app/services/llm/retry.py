"""Shared retry policy for provider calls.

One async-only helper decides how a failed LLM call is retried, whichever
provider is configured. Only errors the :mod:`.errors` taxonomy marks retryable
are retried; backoff is the AWS "full jitter" schedule, so concurrent workers
that fail together do not retry in lockstep.
