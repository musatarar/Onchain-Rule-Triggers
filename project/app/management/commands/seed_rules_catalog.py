"""Seed the demo user's shape and outreach rules catalog.

This command writes the demo owner's shape — what a lead and an event are, and
which columns the lead authors — and the rules follow from it. The rules engine
names no column anywhere; the copy path names two, in
``services/verify.py`` (see #162).

The seeded set is the demo user's starting catalog, weighted: strong, unambiguous signals carry 3, softer ones 2 or 1. Several
rules select the same action on purpose — three separate signals argue for a
usage nudge, and a dormant account argues harder than modest momentum — so
the tally decides rather than evaluation position.

Re-running RESETS the owner's catalog to this set: rules they authored
themselves are deleted, and the seeded actions' label and urgency are
restored. Safe to re-run, but not a merge. It also puts every lead in that
owner's book, since a lead with no owner has no rules and this is the command
that knows who the demo owner is.
